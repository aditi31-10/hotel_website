The mess service is a prominent part of hostel culture, it has been proposed to develop a web application for the owner of “Delhi Mess” to have a unique opportunity to tailor their guests’ experiences, both online and in-person. The website should provide all the relevant information including Menu, online orders, offers, services, contact information etc. It should have log in or sign-up option for both the customer and the admin. Menu items should be shown with their prices. Social media handles to reach the business should be provided. Also, the location should be accessible all the time. Also, admin should be able to change prices, update the menu, access the list of regular customers etc. Thus, our goal is to make “Delhi Mess” stand out and attain maximum customers and let it establish its mark on the online platform.
